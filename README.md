# pairwise-parallelization
This repository is dedicated to help using the parallelization procedure exposed in the following paper:
....
To compile the code just run make in the folder after changing the pathes in the file 
  makefile
The program can be run directly on a command line:
/YourPath/SPAPCA #ofindivudals /YourPath/fileresult.txt
Where #ofindivudals is the number of indivudals and /YourPath/fileresult.txt the name of the file to store the result
Alternatively the script SPAPCA.sh can be run modified and ran
The program is currently limited to a number of individuals of 400,000,000 but we don t recomand running it for that many inidvudals as the file with the composition of all subsets will be too big.
